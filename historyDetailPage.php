			<h2>The Grote of Sint-Bavo Church</h2>
			<p>The Grote of Sint-Bavo Kerk (Great saint-Bavo church) is one of the most well known buildings in Haarlem. Layed against the Grote markt (simply said; big market) the Sint-Bavo church was build inbetween 1370 and 1520 and is the second biggest church in the Netherlands.</p>

			<h2>The Grote Markt</h2>
			<p>In the great market place in the centre of the city are gathered together the larger number of the most interesting buildings, including the quaint old Fleshers' Hall, built by Lieven de Key in 1603, and now containing the archives; the town hall; the old Stadsdoelen, where the burgesses met in arms; the Groote Kerk, or Great Church; and the statue erected in 1856 to Laurens Janszoon Koster, the printer.</p>

			<h2>The Hallen</h2>
			<p>The Frans Hals Museum is divided over two locations: Hof and Hal. They are within a short and scenic walk from each other, through historic Haarlem. Hal is a hotspot of culture on Haarlem’s Grote Markt. But it is also a medley of beautiful architecture as it comprises three different buildings, each from a different century: the Vleeshal (‘Meat Hall’), Vishuisje (‘Fish House’) and Verweyhal (‘Verwey Hall’).</p>

			<h2>The Proveniershof</h2>
			<p>The Proveniershof was founded in 1704 and has a rich history. In 1414 the stately Sint Michiels monastery for women was built here. In 1578 the nuns were chased away by the Protestants at the time of the reformation. Three years later, the Prince of Orange assigned the monastery and the surrounding grounds to the city of Haarlem.</p>

			<h2>The Jopenchurch</h2>
			<p>Jopen is brewed in the Jopenkerk in the heart of Haarlem. This former church has been transformed into a fully-operational, modern brewery. Here, you can sample all of our beers with a view of the entire brewing system.</p>

			<h2>The Waalse church</h2>
			<p>Large windows, glittering mosaics and reflective materials: everything in this basilica is dominated by light. Architect Joseph Cuypers built the church between 1893 and 1906 and was guided by the typical Dutch light. He paid a lot of attention to light, reflection and shadow. The sunlight is an important part of the architecture. If you're lucky the sun will shine and the colors of the windows will shine against walls and columns.</p>

			<h2>Mill of Adriaan</h2>
			<p>A visit to Haarlem is not complete without a guided tour of De Adriaan windmill. It is a smock mill, a wooden towered mill, built in 1778 on the foundations of an ancient defensive tower near the centre of the town.</p>

			<h2>Amsterdamse gate</h2>
			<p>The Amsterdamse poort (Amsterdam gate) was build around the year 1400. Originally, it was called the Spaarnwoude gate, since it lead through the Spaarnwoude to Amsterdam, but has since been renamed to the more simple title it owns today.</p>

			<img src="img/bakenshofje.jpg" alt="hof van bakens" width="400px" height="300px" id="locationpic" >
			<h2>Hof van Bakens</h2>
			<p>The hofje was founded from the legacy of Dirck van Bakenes (or Dirc van Bakenesse) in 1395. This makes it the oldest hofje in the Netherlands. The earliest mention of it in town records is from the History of Haarlem by Samuel Ampzing in 1628, who claims to have copied the stichtingsbrief or letter of foundation (since lost).</p>
